# RTP
The repo is to collect data for RTP performance analysis and mapping

# Required datasets for performance analysis

1. Transit stops and high frequency stops

2. Bikeways / bike facility

3. Sidewalks & sidewalk ramps

4. Tail/multi-use path

5. MTIP map

6. Title VI category 3 and 4

The MPO facilities include bikeways and sidewalks. The steps for performance analysis are listed in 1) coburg_sidewalks_bike_lanes; 2) sidewalks_MPO; 3) bikeways_MPO; and 4) facilities in the 'RTP/data' folder and 5) system_completeness in the RTP/analysis folder.

## Mapping RTP projects (2045)

1. Reivew project lists and compare between years 2040 and 2045

The script [*reivew_RTP.py*](https://github.com/dongmeic/RTP/blob/main/projlist/review_RTP.py) includes all the functions used to review RTP project list spreadsheets and GIS data. 

2. Modify GIS data from year 2040 for 2045
